# Progress: PDF Reader MCP Server (Guidelines Applied)

## 1. What Works

- **Project Setup:** Cloned from `filesystem-mcp`, dependencies installed (using pnpm).
- **Core Tool Handler (Consolidated, using `pdfjs-dist`, multi-source, per-source pages):**
  - `read_pdf`: Implemented and integrated.
- **MCP Server Structure:** Basic server setup working.
- **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` created and updated for `1.0.0`.
- **License:** `LICENSE` file created (MIT).
- **GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` refactored for CI/CD according to guidelines. Fixed `pnpm publish` step (`--no-git-checks`), added Test Analytics upload, fixed formatting, fixed Docker build step (`Dockerfile` - pnpm install, prune, LTS node), parallelized publish jobs, fixed pre-commit hook. Git history corrected multiple times.
- **Testing Framework (Vitest):**
  - Integrated, configured. All tests passing. Coverage at ~95% (accepted).
- **Linter (ESLint):**
  - Integrated, configured. Codebase passes all checks.
- **Formatter (Prettier):**
  - Integrated, configured. Codebase formatted.
- **TypeScript Configuration:** `tsconfig.json` updated with strictest settings.
- **Package Configuration:** `package.json` updated.
- **Git Ignore:** `.gitignore` updated (added JUnit report).
- **Sponsorship:** Removed.
- **Project Identity:** Updated scope to `@sylphlab`.
- **Git Hooks:** Configured using Husky, lint-staged, and commitlint.
- **Dependency Updates:** Configured using Dependabot.
- **Compilation:** Completed successfully (`pnpm run build`).
- **Benchmarking:**
  - Created and ran initial benchmarks.
- **Documentation (Mostly Complete):**
  - VitePress site setup.
  - `README.md`, Guide, Design, Performance, Comparison sections reviewed/updated.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` created.
  - Performance section updated with benchmark results.
  - **API documentation generated successfully using TypeDoc CLI.**
  - VitePress config updated with minor additions.
- **Version Control:** All recent changes committed (incl. formatting `fe7eda1`, Dockerfile pnpm install `c202fd4`, parallelization `a569b62`, pre-commit/npm-publish fix `e96680c`, Dockerfile prune fix `02f3f91`, Dockerfile LTS `50f9bdd`, `package.json` path fix `ab1100d`, release commit for `v0.3.17` `bb9d2e5`). Tag `v0.3.17` created and pushed.
- **Package Executable Path:** Fixed incorrect paths (`build/` -> `dist/`) in `package.json` (`bin`, `files`, `start` script).

## 2. What's Left to Build/Verify

- **Runtime Testing (Blocked):** Requires user interaction.
- **Publishing Workflow Test:** Triggered by pushing tag `v0.3.17`. Needs verification.
- **Documentation (Optional Enhancements):**
  - Add complex features (PWA, share buttons, roadmap page) if requested.
- **Release Preparation:**
  - Final review before tagging `1.0.0`.
  - Consider using `standard-version` or similar for final release tagging/publishing.

## 3. Current Status

Project configuration and core functionality are aligned with guidelines. Documentation is largely complete, including generated API docs. Codebase passes all checks and tests (~95% coverage). **Version bumped to `0.3.17` and tag pushed. Project is ready for final review and workflow verification.**

## 4. Known Issues/Risks

- **100% Coverage Goal:** Currently at **~95%**. This level is deemed acceptable.
- **`pdfjs-dist` Complexity:** API complexity, text extraction accuracy depends on PDF, potential Node.js compatibility nuances.
- **Error Handling:** Basic handling implemented; specific PDF parsing errors might need refinement.
- **Performance:** Initial benchmarks run on a single sample file. Performance on diverse PDFs needs further investigation if issues arise.
- **Per-Source Pages:** Logic handles per-source `pages`; testing combinations is important (covered partially by benchmarks).
- **TypeDoc Script Issue:** Node.js script for TypeDoc failed, but CLI workaround is effective.
