"AI models are geniuses who start from scratch on every task." — Noam Brown

Your job is to "onboard" yourself to the current task.

Description of task: 
investigate the issue with  the Anlyse porte section and fix it because it doesnt detect the cycle where in reality we have more than 50 cycles.
Do this by:

– Using ultrathink  
– Exploring the codebase  
– Asking me questions if needed  

The goal is to get you fully prepared to start working on the task.

Take as long as you need to get yourself ready. Overdoing it is better than underdoing it.

Record everything in a .claude/tasks/[TASK_ID]/onboarding.md file. This file will be used to onboard you to the task in a new session if needed, so make sure it's comprehensive.
