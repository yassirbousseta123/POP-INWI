# Incident Lens Implementation Tasks

## Overview
Implementation of root cause analysis feature for temperature anomalies in BGU-ONE data center.

## Tasks

### Research & Planning Phase
- [x] Read and understand existing project structure
- [x] Analyze ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS PDF for technical approaches
- [x] Extract temperature thresholds from inwi manual
- [x] Design system architecture for fast & reliable analysis
- [x] Create implementation plan considering any time range input

### Core Implementation Phase
- [x] Create analyzer.py module with RootCauseAnalyzer class ✅ TESTED
- [x] Implement data quality assessment functions ✅ TESTED
- [x] Build cause detection modules: ✅ TESTED
  - [x] CLIM failure detector ✅ TESTED
  - [x] Environmental cause detector ✅ TESTED
  - [x] Door event detector ✅ TESTED
  - [x] Power anomaly detector ✅ TESTED
- [x] Implement confidence scoring system ✅ TESTED
- [x] Create evidence aggregation logic ✅ TESTED

### Integration Phase
- [x] Add recommender.py module for actionable insights ✅ TESTED
- [ ] Update requirements.txt with necessary dependencies  
- [ ] Integrate analyzer with existing detector.py
- [x] Create data preprocessing utilities ✅ TESTED
- [x] Build caching layer for performance ✅ TESTED

### UI Development Phase
- [ ] Add Incident Lens tab to Streamlit app
- [ ] Create input form for time range and thresholds
- [ ] Design results display with:
  - [ ] Timeline visualization
  - [ ] Root cause ranking table
  - [ ] Confidence gauges
  - [ ] Detailed explanations
- [ ] Add export functionality (PDF/CSV)

### Testing & Optimization Phase
- [ ] Write unit tests for each detector
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Optimize for <1 second response time
- [ ] Test with various time ranges (1 hour to 1 year)

### Documentation Phase
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Add inline code comments

## Current Status
Currently in planning phase. Ready to begin implementation of core analyzer module.
